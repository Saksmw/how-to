<h4 class="walkthrough">Walkthrough for stitches</h4>
<h3 id="Yarn Over">Yarn over</h3><p> Either use the hand not holding the hook to wrap yarn over the hook from backside and then over top, or use
    the hand holding the hook to manipulate your hook to do the same thing. also known as yarn round hook
</p>
<h3 id="loop">Slip Knot</h3><p> The Beginning of all crocheting starts out the same. You must have the yarn started on your crochet hook.
    The way you attach the yarn to your hook is with what is known as a slip knot. You want to make sure you leave a small section of yarn as a tail
    so that the stitches don't pull loose. Wrap the yarn around your hook in a loose loop with the end of the loop crossing over the beginning of the strand.
    Take the part of the yarn leading to your skein/ball and wrap it around the hook a second time. pull this new loop through the first loop. Leave the
    new loop on the hook and hold the yarn on either side of your loose slip knot and pull both ends to tighten the knot.
</p>
<h3 id="chain"></h3>Chain<p>Now that you have your starting knot we can create a chain. Alot of crochet patterns require you to
    begin your project with a chain. The chain stitch is the foundation of all other stitches. You yarn over and draw the new
loop through the loop on your hook. You do not want your chain to be pulled to tight inorder to be able to make other stitches in the chain.
However you dont want your chain to be too loose either or your pattern will appear to have threads that can snag and tear. </p>
<h3 id="single">Single</h3>
<p>Now that you have a chain you will insert your hook into the second chain from the hook. yarn over and pull through
    the loops of your chain. Yarn over and pull through both loops on the hook. pull the yarn to tighten the stitch but not too much.
</p>
<h3 id="half-double"> Half-Double Crochet</h3><p> For this example we will do it as if we had done single crochet in the previous row
    chain two and turn your pattern and hook around. Yarn over and insert the hook into the last stitch of the previous row
    yarn over and pull through your stitch making it so you now have three loops on your hook. Yarn over and pull
    through all three loops.
</p>
<h3 id="double">Double Crochet</h3><p> For this example we will again assume we had done a row of single crochet.
    Its the same no matter what type of stitch we did on the previous row. Chain two and turn. Yarn over and insert into
    the last stitch of the previous row. Yarn over and pull through loops of stitch; this will give you three 
    loops on the hook. Yarn over and pull through just the first two loops on the hook; making it so you have two
    loops on the hook. Yarn over and pull through the two loops on the hook. Tighten the stitch.</p>
<h3 id="treble">Treble or Triple Crochet</h3><p>
    Just like with the previous examples we are going to assume we just finished a row of single crochet. Chain three
    and turn. Yarn over hook twice and insert hook into last stitch of previous row. Yarn over and draw yarn through
    loops of the previous stitch; you now have four loops on the hook. Yarn over and pull through first two loops;
    you now have three loops on the hook. Yarn over and draw through the first two loops; yarn over and pull through
    remaining two loops. tighten stitch.
</p>
<h3 id="slip">Slip Stitch</h3><p>
    The slip stitch is used for many things including connecting between two rounds. Insert hook into stitch you are 
    attempting to connect to. Yarn over and pull through the stitch and the loop already on the hook. tighten stitch.
